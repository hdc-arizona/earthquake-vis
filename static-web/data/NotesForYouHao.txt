% Intensity Measures:

% Diaphragm Force: is the force due to excitation(earthquake) on masses 
% Shear: is the horizontal force carried by each floor
% Moment: the effect of a force at a distance 

% Drift: Corresponding to the deformation in each floor level
% Interstory Drift: The difference in the drift in consecutive floors 
% Interstory Drift Ratio: The ratio of interstory drift to corresponding floor height
